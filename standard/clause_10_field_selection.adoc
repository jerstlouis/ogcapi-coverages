== Requirements Class "Field Selection"

=== Overview

The "Field Selection" Requirements Class defines the `properties` parameter for selecting a subset of the fields to retrieve from the coverage resource (`/collections/{collection_id}/coverage`).
The available fields for the coverage, for example individual imagery bands, are defined in the schema resource, and correspond to the _range type_ in CIS.
The order of the fields as listed in the value of the parameter also determines the order in which those fields will be ordered in the response, if the negotiated format has such a concept of field order.

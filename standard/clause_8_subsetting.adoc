== Requirements Class "Subsetting"

=== Overview

The "Subsetting" Requirements Class specifies the `subset`, `bbox` and `datetime` parameters for coverage resource, allowing to retrieve only a subset of the coverage along one or more dimensions.
With the `subset` and `datetime` parameters, a subset operation may be a trimming operation (preserving dimensionality) or slicing operation (reducing dimensions), depending on whether a single coordinate or an interval is used.
Negotiating a response in a format with limited multidimensionality support, such as image-based format like GeoTIFF, also implies a reduced dimensionality.

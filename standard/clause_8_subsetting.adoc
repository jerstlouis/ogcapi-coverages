== Requirements Class Subsetting

=== Overview

The `Coverage Subset` Requirements Class defines the application of query parameters against a Coverage resource using the HTTP GET operation. The effect is to generate a subset of the coverage and all of its' parts. That subset is then returned to the client in the HTTP response.

Implementors of this Requirements Class must also implement the <<rc-geodata-coverage-section,`GeoData Coverage`>> Requirements Class.

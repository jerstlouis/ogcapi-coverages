== Requirements Class "Spatial Subsetting"

=== Overview

The "Spatial Subsetting" Requirements Class specifies the `subset` parameter for the coverage resource, allowing to retrieve only a subset of the coverage along one or more spatial dimensions.
With the `subset` parameter, a subset operation may be a trimming operation (preserving dimensionality) or slicing operation (reducing dimensions), depending on whether a single coordinate or an interval is used.

Negotiating a response in a format with limited multidimensionality support, such as image-based format like GeoTIFF, also implies a reduced dimensionality.

When subsetting a coverage within a lower and upper bound, a trimming operation is performed, and the response will preserve the dimension being subset.
When subsetting a coverage for a single value, a slicing operation is performed, and the response will not contain that dimension being subset.

When subsetting a coverage, the geometry of the cells must be considered.

If the value for the cells of the coverage represent an area, the geometry of the cells extends over that whole area.
If the value for the cells of the coverage represent a point, the geometry of the cells is only that infinitely small point.

The values to include in the response will be all **cells whose geometry's interior** intersects the **interior or the boundary of the subsetting extent**, in line with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM[DE9-IM] model.

For cells whose geometry is a point, this will **include** all cells falling exactly on the boundary of the subset (**the interior of a point is the point itself**).

For cells whose geometry is an area, this will **exclude** the cells boundaries falling exactly on the boundary of the subset (**the interior of an area excludes its boundary**).

In addition to the `subset` parameter, server implementations must also support a convenience `bbox` parameter, which maps directly to an equivalent `subset` parameter performing a trimming operation.
While the `subset` parameter allows to more explicitly reference a particular spatial axis and avoiding related confusion, the `bbox` parameter may feel simpler and more familiar to some users.
Both the `subset` and the `bbox` parameters are aligned with the spatial subsetting capabilities of OGC API - Maps.

== Requirements Class "Temporal Subsetting"

=== Overview

The "Temporal Subsetting" Requirements Class specifies the `subset` parameter for the coverage resource, allowing to retrieve only a subset of the coverage along the primary temporal dimension.
With the `subset` parameter, a subset operation may be a trimming operation (preserving dimensionality) or slicing operation (reducing dimensions), depending on whether a single coordinate or an interval is used.
Negotiating a response in a format with limited multidimensionality support, such as image-based format like GeoTIFF, also implies a reduced dimensionality.

When subsetting a coverage for a single value, a slicing operation is performed, and the response will not contain that dimension being subset.

If the value for the cells of the coverage represent an area, the geometry of the cells extends over that whole area.

For cells whose geometry is a point, this will **include** all cells falling exactly on the boundary of the subset (**the interior of a point is the point itself**).

For cells whose geometry is an area, this will **exclude** the cells boundaries falling exactly on the boundary of the subset (**the interior of an area excludes its boundary**).

In addition to the `subset` parameter, server implementations must also support a convenience `datetime` parameter, which maps directly to an equivalent `subset` parameter performing either a slicing or trimming operation.
While the `subset` parameter allows to more explicitly reference the primary temporal dimension, the `datetime` parameter may feel simpler and more familiar to some users.
Both the `subset` and the `bbox` parameters are aligned with the temporal subsetting capabilities of OGC API - Maps.

[[rc_subsetting_general]]
== Requirements Class "General Subsetting"

=== Overview

The "General Subsetting" Requirements Class specifies the `subset` parameter for the coverage resource, allowing to retrieve only a subset of the coverage along one or more dimensions beyond spatial and the primary temporal dimension.
With the `subset` parameter, a subset operation may be a trimming operation (preserving dimensionality) or slicing operation (reducing dimensions), depending on whether a single coordinate or an interval is used.
Negotiating a response in a format with limited multidimensionality support, such as image-based format like GeoTIFF, also implies a reduced dimensionality.

^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/collections/rc-bbox-response*
^|A|If the ``bbox`` parameter is provided by the client and supported by the server, then only resources that have a spatial geometry that intersects the bounding box SHALL be part of the result set.
^|B|If a resource has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
^|C|The `bbox` parameter SHALL also match all resources in the collection that are not associated with a spatial geometry.

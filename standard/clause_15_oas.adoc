== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

=== Overview

The OpenAPI 3.0 Requirements Class is applicable to OGC API - Coverages as well.
So an implementation of _OGC API - Coverages_ which supports OpenAPI 3.0 as an API Description format must also comply with the _OGC API - Common_ oas30 Conformance Class.

In addition, this optional requirements class defines the `.getCoverage` operationId suffix to be used in order to facilitate the identification of coverage resources available from an API.

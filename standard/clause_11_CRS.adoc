[[rc-crs]]
== Requirement Class "Coordinate Reference System"

=== Overview

The `crs` parameter defines the output CRS (equivalent to `OUTPUTCRS` in WCS 2.0)
This section describes how to request a coverage to be returned in a specific CRS.

As defined in this standard, coverage conceptually is associated with native CRS (also called a _storage CRS_) which is indicated in the collection description.
This native CRS is the default output CRS if no `crs` parameter is specified, and the only supported output CRS without support for this requirements class.
The `Content-Crs:` header (see <<rc-core>>) specifies the CRS used in the response to avoid any confusion as to the CRS of a response.

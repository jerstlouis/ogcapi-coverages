description: |-
  Request a specific resolution for one or more dimension in terms of the minimum distance between two samples.
  For a regular grid coverage output, the resolution corresponds to the grid resolution.
  The parameter value is a comma separated list of dimensions followed by values in parentheses.
  For example, `resolutions=Lat(0.5),Lon(0.5),time(P1D)` specifies a 0.5 degrees spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution.
  For server supporting Spatial subsetting, the `Lat` and `Lon` dimensions are supported for a geographic output CRS,
  and the `E` and `N` dimensions are supported for a projected output CRS, with the resolution specified in positive CRS units.
  For a 3D CRS, the resolution for an additional `h` dimension can be specified, corresponding to the height above the ellipsoid
  for a geographic CRS, or to a vertical dimension usually called _z_ in a 3D Cartesian CRS.
  For server supporting Temporal subsetting, the `time` dimension is supported referring to the primary temporal dimensions,
  with units specified in ISO 8601 UTC / Gregorian date and time.
  For server supporting General subsetting, a resolution for additional dimensions, as named in the collection description's extent,
  can also be specified in the units of those dimensions.

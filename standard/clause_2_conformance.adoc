== Conformance
Conformance with this standard shall be checked using the tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to claim conformance, are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site.

The one Standardization Target for this standard is Web APIs.

OGC API-Common provides a common foundation for OGC API standards. Therefore, this standard should be viewed as an extension to API-Common. 

This standard identifies five Conformance Classes. Each Conformance Class has an associated Requirements Class. The Requirements Classes define the functional requirements which will be tested through the associated Conformance Class.

The Requirements Classes for OGC API-Coverages are:

* *GeoDataCoverage*
* *Subset*
* *Scaling*
* *RangeSubset*
* *Tiles*
* *DomainSetSubset*
* *HTML*
* *JSON*
* *OpenAPI 3.0*

The _GeoDataCoverage_ Requirements Class is the minimal useful service interface for an OGC Coverages API. The requirements specified in this Requirements Class are mandatory for all implementations of API-Coverages.

The _Subset_ Requirements Class provides capabilities to select a sub-set of a `Coverage` using a multi-dimensional "bounding box" which is suitable for any coordinate reference system and any dimension.

The _HTML_ and _JSON_ Requirements Classes address support for encodings commonly used with APIs.

The _OpenAPI 3.0_ Requirements Class addresses the use of the OpenAPI 3.0 standard to document and communicate the API Definition.

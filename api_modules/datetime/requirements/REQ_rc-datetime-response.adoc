^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/collections/rc-datetime-response* 
^|A |If the `datetime` parameter is provided by the client and supported by the server, then only resources that have a temporal geometry that intersects the temporal information in the `datetime` parameter SHALL be part of the result set. If a resource has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or all relevant temporal properties.
^|B |The ``datetime`` parameter SHALL match all resources in the collection that are not associated with a temporal geometry.

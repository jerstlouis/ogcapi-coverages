|Target type |Web API Query Parameter
|===

The `datetime` parameter selects resources based on their temporal extent. The definition of temporal extent is specific to the resource type being filtered.

The `datetime` parameter is defined as follows:

include::./requirements/REQ_rc-datetime-definition.adoc[]

While the processing of the `datetime` parameter is specific to the resource and operation for which it is applied, there is a general set of requirements which all implementations must address.

include::./requirements/REQ_rc-datetime-response.adoc[]

"Intersects" means that the time (instant or period) specified in the parameter `datetime` includes a timestamp that is part of the temporal geometry of the resource (again, a time instant or period). For time periods this includes the start and end time.

|====
| Note | ISO 8601-2 distinguishes open start/end timestamps (double-dot) and unknown start/end timestamps (empty string). For queries, an unknown start/end has the same effect as an open start/end.

.A date-time
=================
February 12, 2018, 23:20:52 GMT:

`datetime=2018-02-12T23%3A20%3A52Z`
=================

For resources with a temporal property that is a timestamp (like `lastUpdate`), a date-time value would match all resources where the temporal property is identical.

For resources with a temporal property that is a date or a time interval, a date-time value would match all resources where the timestamp is on that day or within the time interval.

.Intervals
=================
February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 GMT to March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 GMT:

`datetime=2018-02-12T00%3A00%3A00Z%2F2018-03-18T12%3A31%3A12Z`

February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC or later:

`datetime=2018-02-12T00%3A00%3A00Z%2F..`

March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 UTC or earlier:

`datetime=..%2F2018-03-18T12%3A31%3A12Z`
=================

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to OpenAPI 3.0 is available at link:http://beta.schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/0.1/collections/openapi/parameters/datetime.yaml[datetime.yaml].

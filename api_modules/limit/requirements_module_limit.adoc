The `limit` parameter limits the number of resources that can be returned in a single response.

include::./requirements/REQ_rc-limit-definition.adoc[]

While the processing of the `limit` parameter is specific to the resource and operation for which it is applied, there is a general set of requirements which all implementations must address.

include::./requirements/REQ_rc-limit-response.adoc[]

The number of resources returned depends on the server and the value of the `limit` parameter.

*   The client can request a limit to the number of resources returned.
*   The server may have a default value for the limit, and a maximum limit.
*   If the server has any more results available than it returns (the number it returns is less than or equal to the requested/default/maximum limit) then the server will include a link to the next set of results.

Since many servers will place a limit on the size of their responses, clients should be prepared to handle a paged response even if they have not specified a `limit` parameter in their query.

The effect of the limit parameter is to divide the response into a number of pages. Each page (except for the last) contains the specified number of entities. The response contains the first page. Additional pages can be accessed through hyperlink navigation.

Providing `prev` links supports navigating back and forth between pages, but depending on the implementation approach it may be too complex to implement.

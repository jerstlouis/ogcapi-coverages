== Extension Classs

[[extensions-overview]]
=== Overview
In addition to the _OGC API - Coverages - Part 1: Core, _"Core"_ requirement class which every implementation claiming conformance must implement,
a number of optional conformance classes are also defined in _Part 1: Core_ which an implementation optionally may support, and some additional extensions are planned. These extensions are as follows.

^|*Extension* ^|*Purpose*
| Part 2: Filtering and deriving fields | only include cells for the resulting coverage if they match a query predicate, define new fields based on existing ones, using an expression language such as https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065.html[CQL2]. See #164.
| https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-009.html[OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core and Part 3: Workflows and Chaining] | accept an OGC API - Coverage as an input to a process, or return an OGC API - Coverage as an output from a _OGC API - Procesess_ process
| https://docs.ogc.org/is/08-068r3/08-068r3.html[Web Coverage Processing Service] | process WCPS analytics queries in the server (see #97)
| Transactions | insert, delete, or update a coverage on a server (to be based on Common CRUD building blocks, see also https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-087.html#rc-scenes[Scenes requirement class permissions for CRUD operations])
| Range Subsetting _(now in Core)_ | extract range components ("bands", "variables") from a coverage
| Scaling _(now in Core)_ | change resolution of a gridd coverage
| CRS _(now in Core)_ | change the projection of a coverage
| Interpolation | apply a particular interpolation method when interpolation occurs during request processing
